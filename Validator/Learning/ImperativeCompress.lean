-- ImperativeCompress is a memoizable version of the validation algorithm.
-- On top of ImperativeCompress it also includes compress and expand, which is more efficient.
-- It is intended to be used for explanation purposes. This means that it gives up speed for readability. Thus it has no memoization implemented.
-- This version of the algorithm also avoids using any Monads, so it is verbose compared to a version that would use monads.
